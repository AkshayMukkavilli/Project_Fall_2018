# Project_Fall_2018

The aim of the project is to identify the extent to which, the structure of customer reviews on e-commerce sites defines the sales of a product.
We have started with Amazon.com as the base to conduct some tests based on the data that is being acquired.


The file named ReviewGrabber.py takes a list of ASIN numbers as an input in the form of a text file and saves all the reviews of 
each product in a separate text file and names it in the form: " ASIN_Number.txt ".

Each line in the text file corresponds to one customer review.
