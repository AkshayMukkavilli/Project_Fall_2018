# Project_Fall_2018

The aim of the project is to identify the extent to which, the structure of customer reviews on e-commerce sites defines the sales of a product.
We have started with Amazon.com as the base to conduct some tests based on the data that is being acquired.

====================================================================================================================


The file named ReviewGrabber.py takes a list of ASIN numbers as an input in the form of a text file(asins.txt) and saves all the reviews of 
each product in a separate text file and names it in the form: " ASIN_Number.txt ".

In the input text file asins.txt, I have given the ASIn numbers of two products. One of the products has just 13 reviews and the other 
product with over 400 reviews just to make sure if it works.

Each line in the output text files corresponds to one customer review.
