 
 These are EXACTLY what we needed to help with my barely verbal 3YO after discussing different ways to help her out at home with her speech therapist! This seller was also so kind and sent these to us super quick! I'm the one who should be thanking you for these wonderful cards!! Definitely plan on looking at your items and ordering more :)
 YES!  Great quality and helps our 3 year old.  Now, I'm not the enemy.  Now, we just follow the schedule.  She can read a little too, so I like it for that reason as well.
 I am glad I got these cards, they are helping both my son and I to stay on top of his daily routines. He is much more willing to follow through with his tasks because the expectations are clearly laid out for him and he knows what is coming up next.  Also, I appreciate that a "pray" card is included.
 I had great plans for these but I didnâ€™t get enough time before they were lost or ruined by the kids. Purely my fault but, Possibly they would work better if they came with the ability to stick on a wall or board.
 These have been a lifesaver for here at home. My four year old has Sensory Processing Disorder and these help keep him on track and not overwhelmed.<br/>Love these!
 These are exactly what I needed!  Great quality and wonderful seller.  Thank you!!!
 I added magnets to the backs and this is perfect to help my child get excited over her routine! Wonderful!
 Nice quality.  Wanted them for a stroke patient who lost a lot of their verbal skills.
 Granddaughter loved them.
 Great tools to help me create good habits for my kids. I stick them on the wall with time schedule so they know when doing their routines.
 They are high quality, sturdy flash cards
 These routine cards are great.  Great idea : )  Thank you
 Beautiful
